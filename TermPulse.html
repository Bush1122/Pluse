                <h1 class="mt-5 font-weight-bold display-3">Terms of Use</h1>

                <p class="mt-2">Last updated: May 16th, 2018.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">While our accounting software allowed us to enter our income, expenses and invoices and
                    view reports, it didn’t handle forecasts very well. It definitely didn’t let us add possible income
                    and expense items to see how they would affect our bottom line into the future.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">We built Pulse as a way to help small businesses (like ours) manage their cash flow more
                    easily.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">Pulse gives you the ability to understand your financial position at any time, past,
                    present or future. While cash flow spreadsheets and accounting software focus on the totals, Pulse
                    gives you the ability to make the tough daily decisions you face when running a small business.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-5 font-weight-bold">Communications</h4>
                <p class="mt-3">By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing
                    or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving
                    any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions
                    provided in any email we send. You agree that we can use your company name or logo in our
                    advertising and marketing unless and until you tell us in writing not to.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-5 font-weight-bold">Purchases</h4>
                <p class="mt-3">If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service
                    ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including,
                    without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, your billing
                    address, and your shipping information.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s)
                    or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply
                    to us is true, correct and complete.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">The service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating
                    payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to
                    provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.

                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including
                    but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the
                    product or service, error in your order or other reasons.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or
                    illegal transaction is suspected.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">If you sign up for an Account, and you don't cancel your Account within 30 days, you
                    will be billed monthly starting on the 30th day after your Account was initially created. If you
                    cancel prior to the processing of your first invoice on the 30th day, you will not be charged.</p>


                <h4 class="mt-5 font-weight-bold">Refunds</h4>
                <p class="mt-3">If you are not satisfied with the service, we will issue a full refund up to 30 days
                    after Purchase if your Account is canceled within 30 days of that Purchase. Subsequent Purchases are
                    not eligible for refunds.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">Refunds will be issued to the credit card used to make the Purchase. We will not issue
                    cash refunds. If we determine that charges were made in error, then we will credit your account with
                    the appropriate amount.</p>


                <h4 class="mt-5 font-weight-bold">Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h4>
                <p class="mt-3">We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may
                    experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites.
                    The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or
                    current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the
                    Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the
                    Service.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors,
                    inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>



                <h4 class="mt-5 font-weight-bold">Acceptable Use</h4>
                <p class="mt-3">You are solely responsible for all Customer Data (as defined below), and are liable for
                    your Customer Data and the manner in which you collect or distribute your Data to third parties. We
                    reserve the right to remove any Customer Data from our Service that we determine is in violation of
                    these Terms.</p>
                <p class="mt-3"></p>
                <p class="mt-3"></p>

                <h4 class="mt-5 font-weight-bold">Customer Data</h4>
                <p class="mt-3">“Customer Data” means any personal data that you input into Pulse.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">You are solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability,
                    classification, and intellectual property right to use Customer Data and shall obtain and maintain
                    all consents necessary for using and processing the Data in accordance with these Terms. You hereby
                    represent and warrant that (a) any personally identifiable information about your Account users that

                    laws or rights of any third party, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights,
                    rights of privacy, or rights of publicity, and is not inconsistent with the terms of any applicable
                    privacy policies. Pulse takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Customer Data that
                    you or any third party provides, posts, publishes or transmits using the Services. You shall be
                    solely responsible for Customer Data and the consequences of using, disclosing, or transmitting it,
                    and you agree that Pulse is acting strictly as a data processor.</p>


                <h4 class="mt-5 font-weight-bold">Accounts and Passwords</h4>

                    accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or

                    immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

                    responsible for properly cancelling your account. An email or phone request to cancel your account

                <p class="mt-3">If you wish to have your account permanently deleted, you can accomplish this task
